# 🌟 Welcome to My GitHub!

Hi! I'm Kenza, and I'm thrilled to share my journey of mastering AWS and CI/CD pipelines with you!  
  
Feel free to explore my projects, read my articles, and learn with me! 🚀


## 📝 Article 1: What is CI/CD?

In this article, I dive into the world of CI/CD pipelines, explaining the concept, its benefits, and the essential AWS services I used to implement a CI/CD workflow.  

### Check out the article here: [What is CI/CD?](https://github.com/Kzax01/AWS-CI-CD-Pipeline/blob/main/Part%201%20CICD%20full%20Explanation.md)


## 🔒 Article 2: Securing CI/CD Pipelines with AWS & Cybersecurity Tools

Security is critical in every step of a CI/CD pipeline. In this article, I explore how to secure your CI/CD pipeline using AWS services, as well as integrating cybersecurity tools like BurpSuite to protect your code and infrastructure.

Key points covered in the article:

- **Securing the Code**: Ensure that the code pushed to repositories is secure.
- **Using Security Tools**: Integrating BurpSuite and other tools into your pipeline.
- **IAM and Permissions**: Managing access securely to prevent unauthorized access.

## 🚧 Next Step: Building a secure AWS CI/CD Architecture

Now that we've covered the basics, it's time to move to the next step of this huge project: **Building an AWS CI/CD architecture!**

We will be using **Terraform** & **AWS Services** through the console for a banking app _(fictional scenario that've created)_.

## **➡️ This project has been paused because I'm working on Terraform Associate certification. Right after I got it ( FEB 2025) - we'll go back getting our hands dirty !**

Stay tuned for updates! **[In Progress]**
