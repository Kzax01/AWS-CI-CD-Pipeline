## 🔒 Article 2: Securing CI/CD Pipelines with AWS & Cybersecurity Tools

Security is critical in every step of a CI/CD pipeline. In this article, I explore how to secure your CI/CD pipeline using AWS services, as well as integrating cybersecurity tools like BurpSuite to protect your code and infrastructure.

Key points covered in the article:

- **Securing the Code**: Ensure that the code pushed to repositories is secure.
- **Using Security Tools**: Integrating BurpSuite and other tools into your pipeline.
- **IAM and Permissions**: Managing access securely to prevent unauthorized access.
